#### Motivation
>When it comes to the job market, they look for work experience when hiring. However, seeking expertise in today’s job market is extremely difficult for students or those entering the workforce. In specific fields, it is hard for them to apply their skills and collaborate with others to build up their portfolio or resume. 

> On the other hand, Managers or creators find it challenging to seek true talent and develop their ideas into a product. Additionally, it is difficult for students to keep track of internship posts on various platforms. This application is designed to solve this problem by creating a platform where college students can look for real-world projects to enhance their resumes and expand their networks through collaborative projects. 

> This is helpful for managers as they can examine people’s projects as proof of concept and make hiring decisions. The motivation behind this project is to encourage people to build ideas together to gain experience for getting a job or creating a company, regardless of major or college.
